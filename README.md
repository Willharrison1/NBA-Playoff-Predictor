# NBA-Playoff-Predictor
As we are now entering the NBA playoffs, I wanted to create a program that can help me have a better grasp on what teams will win and what teams with lose using probabilities. If I can predict winning teams, it makes it easier to bet on each game and potentially have a better idea on which games will be close and which games could be blow outs.

-   Predicting games is obviously a tricky thing to do since if it was easy, everyone would do it.

Like with any sport, basketball has thousands of stats that can be used to incorporate a teams likely hood of success and failure.

-   Home or Away
-   Injuries
-   Losing Streaks
-   Opponent Strategy
-   Off Games

I needed to find a simple yet comprehensive way to cover all of my bases.

# Getting Started

[This is what the data for each team looks like raw.](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/schedule/_/name/bos/seasontype/2)

I wanted to get the match data from each team and give them home stats and away stats since that is an important factor in deciding games, escpecially in the playoffs.
